        "[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) is a Python framework for [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model). This tutorial will assist you in getting started. Working through the tutorial will help you discover the core features of Mesa.  Through the tutorial, you are walked through creating a starter-level model. Functionality is added progressively as the process unfolds. Should anyone find any errors, bugs, have a suggestion, or just are looking for clarification, [let us know](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues)!\n",

        "Next, *space* is added to allow agents to move based on the change in wealth as time progresses.\n",

The scheduler can be configured to activate agents in different orders. This can be important as the order in which agents are activated can impact the results of the model [Comer2014]. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents -- usually all of them -- are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.\n",

This class activates all the agents once per step, in random order. Every agent is expected to have a ``step`` method. The step method is the action the agent takes when it is activated by the model schedule. We add an agent to the schedule using the `add` method; when we call the schedule's `step` method, the model shuffles the order of the agents, then activates and executes each agent's ```step``` method.

        "The data collector stores three categories of data: model-level variables, agent-level variables, and tables (which are a catch-all for everything else). Model- and agent-level variables are added to the data collector along with a function for collecting them. Model-level collection functions take a model object as an input, while agent-level collection functions take an agent object as an input. Both then return a value computed from the model or each agent at their current state. When the data collector’s `collect` method is called, with a model object as its argument, it applies each model-level collection function to the model, and stores the results in a dictionary, associating the current value with the current step of the model. Similarly, the method applies each agent-level collection function to each agent currently in the schedule, associating the resulting value with the step of the model, and the agent’s `unique_id`.\n",

At the agent level, we want to collect every agent's wealth at every step. At the model level, let's measure the model's [Gini Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient), a measure of wealth inequality."
