	abstract = {Managing non-communicable diseases requires policy makers to adopt a whole systems perspective that adequately represents the complex causal architecture of human behaviour. Agent-based modelling is a computational method to understand the behaviour of complex systems by simulating the actions of entities within the system, including the way these individuals influence and are influenced by their physical and social environment. The potential benefits of this method have led to several calls for greater use in public health research. We discuss three challenges facing potential modellers: model specification, obtaining required data, and developing good practices. We also present steps to assist researchers to meet these challenges and implement their agentbased model.},

However, compared to other approaches, e.g., traditional discrete event simulation, object-oriented simulation and dynamic micro simulation, {MABS} has a number of interesting properties which makes it useful also for other domains. For instance, it supports structure preserving modeling of the simulated reality, simulation of pro-active behavior, parallel computations, and very dynamic simulation scenarios. It is argued that {MABS} is a useful technique for simulating scenarios also in more technical domains. In particular, this hold for the simulation of technical systems that are distributed and involve complex interaction between humans and machines. To illustrate the advantages of {MABS}, an application concerning the monitoring and control of intelligent buildings is described.},

Nonlinear systems are ubiquitous; as mathematician Stanislaw Ulam observed, to speak of “nonlinear science” is like calling zoology the study of “nonelephant animals” (quoted in Campbell et al. 1985, p. 374). The initial phase of research on nonlinear systems focused on deterministic chaos, but more recent studies have investigated the properties of self-organizing systems or anti-chaos. For mathematicians and physicists, the biggest surprise is that complexity lurks within extremely simple systems. For biologists, it is the idea that natural selection is not the sole source of order in the biological world. In the social sciences, it is suggested that emergence—the idea that complex global patterns with new properties can emerge from local interactions—could have a comparable impact.},

	abstract = {Complex Adaptive Systems ({CAS}) is a framework for studying, explaining, and understanding systems of agents that collectively combine to form emergent, global level properties. These agents can be nearly anything, from ants or bees, to brain cells, to water particles in a weather pattern, to groups of cars or people in a city or town. These agents produce emergent patterns via correlated feedbacks throughout the system, feedbacks that create and fortify a basin of attraction: a persistent pattern of behavior that itself is outside of equilibrium. There is also an ever-growing understanding that similar features in complex systems across a diversity of domains may indicate similar fundamental principles at work, and as such there is often utility in using the key features of one system to gain insight into the workings of seemingly distinct fields. Here we also include a brief review of multiple models that attempt to do exactly this, including some of our previous work. Though there is not complete agreement on all aspects and definitions in this field, this introduction also summarizes our understanding of what defines a {CAS}, including the concepts of complexity, agents, adaptation, feedbacks, emergence, and self-organization; and places this definition and its key features in a historical context. Finally we briefly discuss two of the common biases often found that the tools of {CAS} can help counteract: the hierarchical bias, assuming a strong top-down organization; and the complexity bias, the tendency to assign complicated features to agents that turn out to be quite simple.},

In the first category, there are approaches that attempt to represent the cognitive state of rational agents and characterize logically the way such a state leads a rational agent to act. It begins by motivating this approach. It then describes four of the best-known such logical frameworks and discusses the possible roles that such logics can play in helping to engineer artificial agents. In the second category, there are approaches based on representing the strategic structure of a multiagent environment and, in particular, the powers that agents have, either individually or in coalitions.

Each agent decides on a proper action to solve the task using multiple inputs, e.g., history of actions, interactions with its neighboring agents, and its goal. The {MAS} has found multiple applications, including modeling complex systems, smart grids, and computer networks. Despite their wide applicability, there are still a number of challenges faced by {MAS}, including coordination between agents, security, and task allocation. This survey provides a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of {MAS}, starting from definitions, features, applications, challenges, and communications to evaluation.

Marketing phenomena that are too complex for conventional analytical or empirical approaches can often be modeled using this approach. Agent-based modeling investigates aggregate phenomena by simulating the behavior of individual “agents,” such as consumers or organizations. Some useful examples of agent-based modeling have been published in marketing journals, but widespread acceptance of the agent-based modeling method and publication of this method in the highest-level marketing journals have been slowed by the lack of widely accepted standards of how to do agent-based modeling rigorously. We address this need by proposing guidelines for rigorous agent-based modeling. We demonstrate these guidelines, and the value of agent-based modeling for marketing research, through the use of an example. We use an agent-based modeling approach to replicate the Bass model of the diffusion of innovations, illustrating the use of the proposed guidelines to ensure the rigor of the analysis. We also show how extensions of the Bass model that would be difficult to carry out using traditional marketing research techniques are possible to implement using a rigorous agent-based approach.},

Simplification is only applied if and when the model and evidence justify this. This contrasts sharply with the {KISS} approach where one starts with the simplest possible model and only moves to a more complex one if forced to.

Bottom-up building stock models ({BSMs}) can be used to assess policy measures and strategies based on a quantitative assessment of energy demand and {GHG} emissions in the building stock over time. Recent developments in {BSM}-related research have focused on modeling the status quo of the stock and comparatively little focus has been given to improving the modeling methods in terms of stock dynamics. This paper presents a {BSM} based on an agent-based modeling approach ({ABBSM}) that models stock development in terms of new construction, retrofit and replacement by modeling individual decisions on the building level. The model was implemented for the residential building stock of Switzerland and results show that it can effectively reproduce the past development of the stock from 2000 to 2017 based on the changes in policy, energy prices, and costs. {ABBSM} improves on current modeling practice by accounting for heterogeneity in the building stock and its effect on uptake of retrofit and renewable heating systems and by incorporating both regulatory or financial policy measures as well as other driving and restricting factors (costs, energy prices).},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Opportunistic fungal pathogens can cause bloodstream infection and severe sepsis upon entering the blood stream of the host. The early immune response in human blood comprises the elimination of pathogens by antimicrobial peptides and innate immune cells, such as neutrophils or monocytes. Mathematical modeling is a predictive method to examine these complex processes and to quantify the dynamics of pathogen-host interactions. Since model parameters are often not directly accessible from experiment, their estimation is required by calibrating model predictions with experimental data. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical model, parameter estimation can be associated with excessively high computational costs in terms of run time and memory. We apply a strategy for reliable parameter estimation where different modeling approaches with increasing complexity are used that build on one another. This bottom-up modeling approach is applied to an experimental human whole-blood infection assay for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Candida albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Aiming for the quantification of the relative impact of different routes of the immune response against this human-pathogenic fungus, we start from a non-spatial state-based model ({SBM}), because this level of model complexity allows estimating {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a priori{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} unknown transition rates between various system states by the global optimization method {\textless}italic{\textgreater}simulated annealing{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Building on the non-spatial {SBM}, an agent-based model ({ABM}) is implemented that incorporates the migration of interacting cells in three-dimensional space. The {ABM} takes advantage of estimated parameters from the non-spatial {SBM}, leading to a decreased dimensionality of the parameter space. This space can be scanned using a local optimization approach, i.e., {\textless}italic{\textgreater}least-squares error estimation{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} based on an {\textless}italic{\textgreater}adaptive regular grid search{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, to predict cell migration parameters that are not accessible in experiment. In the future, spatio-temporal simulations of whole-blood samples may enable timely stratification of sepsis patients by distinguishing hyper-inflammatory from paralytic phases in immune dysregulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The parsimonious Bass diffusion model is frequently used to forecast adoptions of new products and to compare the life cycles of specific products across countries. To meet these goals, reliable parameter estimates are needed. We develop the asymptotic theory for the three key parameters in the Bass model. For this purpose, we need to make assumptions about the stochastic error process. On doing so, we arrive at an alternative version of the Bass model than the one usually considered in practice, because our model includes an additional variable and it incorporates heteroscedastic errors. The asymptotic theory entails that the parameters, on standardization by their standard errors, do not have the conventional asymptotic behavior. For practical purposes, it means that the t-statistics do not have an (approximate) t-distribution. Using simulation experiments, we address the issue of how these findings carry over to practical situations. In a next set of simulation experiments, we compare our representation with that of Bass and Srinivasan and Mason. Among other things, we document that these two approaches seriously overestimate the precision of the parameter estimators, and that some parameters suffer from a substantial bias. An analysis of 12 series concerning compact disc penetration supports these simulation results. We see the same type of bias in parameter estimates, and our model delivers more accurate forecasts.},

	abstract = {Bass diffusion models are one of the competing paradigms to forecast the diffusion of innovative products or technologies. This approach posits that diffusion patterns can be modeled through two mechanisms: Innovators adopt the new product and imitators purchase the new product when getting in contact with existing users. Crucial for the implementation of the method are the values assigned to the two parameters, usually referred to as p and q, which mathematically describe innovation and imitation mechanisms. The present paper is based on the findings of a research project about policy measures to promote the diffusion of Electric Vehicles in Germany. It investigates how practitioners could choose adequate values for the Bass model parameters to forecast new automotive technologies diffusion with a focus on Electric Vehicles. It considers parameters provided by the literature as well as ad hoc parameter estimations based on real market data for Germany. Our investigation suggests that researchers may be in trouble in electing adequate parameter values since the different eligible parameter values exhibit dramatic variations. Literature values appear discussible and widely variable while ad hoc estimates appear poorly conclusive. A serious problem is that ad-hoc estimates of the Bass p value are highly sensitive to the assumed market potential M. So for plausible values of M, p varies on a high scale. Unless more consolidation takes place in this area, or more confidence can be placed on ad hoc estimates, these findings issue a warning for the users of such approaches and on the policy recommendations that would derive from their use.},

	abstract = {The Bass Model ({BM}) has an excellent track record in the realm of new product sales forecasting. However, its use for optimal dynamic pricing or advertising is relatively limited because the Generalized Bass Model ({GBM}), which extends the {BM} to handle marketing variables, uses only percentage changes in marketing variables, rather than their actual values. This restricts the {GBM}’s prescriptive use, for example, to derive the optimal price path for a new product, conditional on an assumed launch price, but not the launch price itself. In this paper, we employ a utility-based extension of the {BM}, which can yield normative prescriptions regarding both the introductory price and the price path after launch, for the new product. We offer two versions of this utility-based diffusion model, namely, the Bass-Gumbel Diffusion Model ({BGDM}) and the Bass-Logit Diffusion Model ({BLDM}), the latter of which has been previously used. We show that both the {BGDM} and {BLDM} handily outperform the {GBM} in forecasting new product sales using empirical data from four product categories. We discuss how to estimate the {BGDM} and {BLDM} in the absence of past sales data. We compare the optimal pricing policy of the {BLDM} with the {GBM} and derive optimal pricing policies that are implied by the {BLDM} under various ranges of model parameters. We illustrate a dynamic pricing approach that allows managers to derive optimal marketing policies in a computationally convenient manner and extend this approach to a competitive, multiproduct case.

We fit the {BDM} to two large developed markets, the {USA} and Germany, and the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China. We show that the parameters of the classical {BDM} may change substantially if the time period considered is changed by a single year. The diffusion of mobile communication does not follow an S-curve in some cases. We do not formulate an empirical alternative, but we suggest the structure of an integrated diffusion mode that treats adoption as one of five phase changes of the diffusion process. We trace the diffusion of mobile communications in India, and show that the integrated diffusion model provides a framework for understanding this case. We show that diffusion is a complex phenomenon, and that simplistic approaches are not equal to the task of explaining it.},

This study considers the Bass Model for forecasting the diffusion of new products or an innovation in the Malaysian society. The objective of the proposed model is to represent the level of spread on new products among a given set of society in terms of a simple mathematical function that elapsed since the introduction of new products. With limited amount of data available for new products, a robust Bass model was developed to forecast the sales volume. A procedure of the proposed diffusion model was designed and the parameters were estimated. Results obtained by applying the proposed model and numerical calculation show that the proposed Bass diffusion model is robust and effective for forecasting demand of new products. This study concludes that the newly developed bass diffusion of demand function has significantly contributed for forecasting the diffusion of new products.},

	abstract = {Marketing managers and researchers generally agree that analyzing data from social networks and using them to influence consumers' purchase decisions are useful strategies. However, not all social network data may identify the most influential customers. This empirical study of more than 300 students reveals the low explanatory power of friendship networks (e.g., Facebook) and undirected-advice networks (e.g., {LinkedIn}). Only directed-advice networks (e.g., Google+) clearly identify influential consumers. In addition, the results challenge conventional wisdom that firms should target advisers assuming that they have the strongest influence on new product adoption. This study contradicts this common assumption and reveals that structural equivalence drives product adoption more than cohesion because advisees' adoption pressures advisers to purchase the product as well. Finally, the study shows the value of social network data beyond the traditional ego-centric psychographic metrics, such as innovativeness or opinion leadership.},

	abstract = {The study suggests an alternative conceptualization for understanding adoption behavior over time, based on Optimal Distinctiveness Theory. This theory states that social identity derives from a fundamental tension between human needs for validation and similarity to others—the need for assimilation—and a countervailing need for uniqueness and individuation—the need for differentiation. The present study proposes that the effect of the size of the group of consumers who have already adopted a new product on an individual consumer's decision to adopt this product is contingent upon the consumer's two predispositions: the need for assimilation and the need for distinctiveness. Results of empirical research suggested that differently perceived subgroup sizes fulfill consumers' dual needs for distinctiveness and assimilation differently. The influence of the adopters' group size on a consumer's decision to adopt a new product varied among individuals with different levels of needs for distinctiveness and assimilation: when need for distinctiveness was low, the higher was the need for assimilation and the larger was the perceived group size, the higher was the probability of adopting the product. When the need for distinctiveness was high, the lower was the need for assimilation and the larger was the perceived group size, the lower was the probability of adopting the product. In addition, when the need for both distinctiveness and assimilation were high, the probability of adopting the product rose as the perceived group size increased. Implications for product variation, marketing communication, and target groups are discussed. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper we compared {DOI} through random and scale-free social networks using {ABM}. The model predicts faster product adoption for a random network compared with a scale-free network with the same number of nodes due to the presence of hubs. Longer diffusion time in scale-free networks is related to lower information equality. Real world social networks can be a mixture of the two considered extreme cases and also can depend on the type of product.},

As a unique feature of the experiment, students who would generally adopt first were placed in a situation where many of their peers received access to the technology before them, and they then had to decide whether to continue to invest in this digital currency or exit. Our results suggest that when natural early adopters are delayed relative to their peers, they are more likely to reject the technology. We present further evidence that this appears to be driven by identity, in that the effect occurs in situations where natural early adopters' delay relative to others is most visible, and in settings where the natural early adopters would have been somewhat unique in their tech-savvy status. We then show not only that natural early adopters are more likely to reject the technology if they are delayed, but that this rejection generates spillovers on adoption by their peers who are not natural early adopters. This suggests that small changes in the initial availability of a technology have a lasting effect on its potential: Seeding a technology while ignoring early adopters' needs for distinctiveness is counterproductive.},

This study applied the technique of structured equation modeling with multiple group analysis to compare the {TAM}, {ECM}, and {COG} models. Results indicate that {TAM}, {ECM}, and {COG} have quite different assumptions about the underlying constructs that dictate user behavior and thus have different explanatory powers. The six constructs in the three models were synthesized to propose a new Technology Continuance Theory ({TCT}). A major contribution of {TCT} is that it combines two central constructs: attitude and satisfaction into one continuance model, and has applicability for users at different stages of the adoption life cycle, i.e., initial, short-term and long-term users. The {TCT} represents a substantial improvement over the {TAM}, {ECM} and {COG} models in terms of both breadth of applicability and explanatory power.},

Moreover, a framework of "moments that matter" in consumer decision-making process and factors that influence them was elaborated for a possibility to influence consumer behaviour in favour of company’s offers. Furthermore, recommendations for marketers were suggested for deeper understanding the consumer behaviour and their buying strategies to empower marketing campaigns and be a success in the market.

This model, however, is eroding due to a number of factors. What is emerging is a more open model, where companies recognize that not all good ideas will come from inside the organization and not all good ideas created within the organization can be successfully marketed internally. To date, Open Innovation concepts have been regarded as relevant primarily to ‘high-technology’ industries, with examples that include Lucent, 3Com, {IBM}, Intel and Millenium Pharmaceuticals. In this article, we identify organizations in industries outside ‘high technology' that are early adopters of the concept. Our findings demonstrate that many Open Innovation concepts are already in use in a wide range of industries. We document practices that appear to assist organizations adopting these concepts, and discover that Open Innovation is not ipso facto a recipe for outsourcing R\&D. We conclude that Open Innovation has utility as a paradigm for industrial innovation beyond high tech to more traditional and mature industries.},

Our review highlights that (i) the field has considerably matured in studying the diffusion of electric vehicles, (ii) both price-based and preference-based scenarios for mobility transition should be considered in future research, (iii) most of the empirical model calibrations have been confined to Western countries. Not only will the literature benefit from similar research in other Western regions, but also from non-Western nations with their unique mobility transition pathways, (iv) the conceptual modelling framework of studies can be divided into the two categories of theory-driven and heuristic models. The theory-driven models, which include psychological and non-psychological (e.g., activity-based travel) models, tend to use well-established behavioural rules, (v) most of the models have used the random utility maximization concept, social psychological models, and other simple assumptions/thresholds for the decision-making process of agents, (vi) half of the studies did not validate their models, and (vii) two-thirds of studies omitted to discuss interaction topology among agents.

	abstract = {Mathematical modeling of innovation diffusion has attracted strong academic interest since the early 1960s. Traditional diffusion models have aimed at empirical generalizations and hence describe the spread of new products parsimoniously at the market level. More recently, agent-based modeling and simulation has increasingly been adopted since it operates on the individual level and, thus, can capture complex emergent phenomena highly relevant in diffusion research. Agent-based methods have been applied in this context both as intuition aids that facilitate theory-building and as tools to analyze real-world scenarios, support management decisions and obtain policy recommendations. This review addresses both streams of research. We critically examine the strengths and limitations of agent-based modeling in the context of innovation diffusion, discuss new insights agent-based models have provided, and outline promising opportunities for future research. The target audience of the paper includes both researchers in marketing interested in new findings from the agent-based modeling literature and researchers who intend to implement agent-based models for their own research endeavors. Accordingly, we also cover pivotal modeling aspects in depth (concerning, e.g., consumer adoption behavior and social influence) and outline existing models in sufficient detail to provide a proper entry point for researchers new to the field.},

Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling ({ABM}) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most {ABM} work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize {ABM} methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions.},

	abstract = {Market diffusion of new products is driven by the actions and reactions of consumers, distributors, competitors, and other stakeholders, all of whom can be heterogeneous in their individual characteristics, attitudes, needs, and objectives. These actors may also interact with others in various ways (e.g., through word of mouth or social influence). Thus, a typical consumer market constitutes a complex system whose behavior is difficult to foresee because stochastic impulses may give rise to complex emergent patterns of system reactions over time. Agent-based modeling, a relatively novel approach to understanding complex systems, is well equipped to deal with this complexity and, therefore, may serve as a valuable tool for both researchers studying particular market effects and practitioners seeking decision support for determining features of products under development or the appropriate combination of measures to accelerate product diffusion in a market. This paper provides an overview of the strengths and criticisms of such tools. It aims to encourage researchers in the field of innovation management, as well as practitioners, to consider agent-based modeling and simulation as a method for gaining deeper insights into market behavior and making better-informed decisions.},

Agent-based modeling ({ABM}) is a methodology well suited for simulating this system. It complements and extends econometric approaches by incorporating interactions among system members, and adaptation in the system, revealing emergent results. Since {ABM} allows study at the individual unit level, heterogeneity among system members is reflected and modeling at the brand level is possible. Here an {ABM} with consumer and brand agents is described. The brand and product diffusion curve output allows study of diffusion at micro and macro levels, respectively.},

	abstract = {Innovations usually have an initial impact on very few people. The period of learning or early evaluation precedes the diffusion of the technology into the wider addressed population. More than a transfer, this is best characterized as communication of benefits, costs, and compatibility with earlier technologies and a relative assessment of the new state of the art. Innovation development by an organization or individual creates not just a device (i.e., process or tacit knowledge) but concomitantly a capacity on the part of other organizations or persons to use, adopt, replicate, enhance, or modify the technology, skills, or knowledge for their own purposes. How innovations actually diffuse is to understand the communication of progress, and this framing helps one to design innovations and also design the marketing and testing programs to ready innovations for market and launch them efficiently. Diffusion theory's main focus is on the flow of information within a social system, such as via mass media and word-of-mouth communications. This theory presents often in the form of mathematical models of innovation and imitation. Distinct from classical diffusion models, however, consumers are not all identical in how they connect to others within a market or how they respond to information. We examine the effects of various network structures and relational heterogeneity on innovation diffusion within market networks. Specifically, network topology (the structure of how individuals in the market are connected) and the strength of communication links between innovator and follower market segments (a form of relational heterogeneity) are studied. Several research questions concerning network heterogeneity are addressed with an agent-based modeling approach. The present study's findings are based on simulation results that show important effects of network structure on the diffusion process. The ability to speed diffusion varies significantly according to within- and cross-segment communications within a heterogeneous network structure. The implications of the present approach for new product diffusion are discussed, and future research directions are suggested that may add useful insights into the complex social networks inherent to diffusion. A simple summary is that discovery of significant prime communicator nodes in a network allows innovation development practices to be better calibrated to realistically multiple market segments.},

	abstract = {Agent-based model ({ABM}) has been widely used to explore the influence of complex interactions and individual heterogeneity on the diffusion of innovation, while it is seldom used as a forecasting tool in the innovation diffusion literature. This paper introduces a novel approach of forecasting new product diffusion with {ABMs}. The {ABM} is built on the hidden influence network ({HIN}) over which the innovation diffuses. An efficient method is presented to estimate non-structural parameters (i.e., p, q and m) and a multinomial logistic model is formulated to identify the type of the {HIN} for diffusion data. The simulation study shows that the trained logistic model performs well in inferring the {HINs} for most simulated diffusion data sets but poorly for those generated by {ABMs} with similar {HINs}. Therefore, to reduce the possible prediction loss arising from the misspecification of the {HIN}, three methods, namely, the predicted {HIN}, the weighted averaging and simple averaging, are developed to forecast new products diffusion. Their performances are evaluated by using a data set composed of 317 time series on consumer durables penetration. The results show that most identified {HINs} have moderate topology, and that our methods outperform four classical differential equation based diffusion models in both short-term and long-term prediction.},

The main objective is analyze the adoption and diffusion of a reverse innovation across a developing country—the country in which a reverse innovation is first launched—to then analyze its further diffusion in a developed country. While most of literature on diffusion and adoption of innovation is focused on aggregated transversal studies, this chapter utilizes an {ABM} to analyze the phenomenon at the micro market level, that is, observable consumer decisions. As secondary data on sales of reverse innovations is almost unavailable, this study relies on an experimental design with different levels of paid advertising messages and word of mouth, network densities, and market sizes. Results show that a reverse innovation diffuses faster in a developing country and reaches a larger market segment than the diffusion in a developed country. Managers are called to enact an ambidextrous marketing strategy across countries and to expect differentiated diffusion patterns.},

	abstract = {This paper provides theoretical arguments and simulation evidence regarding how a differential equation-based diffusion model ({DE}) can be used to improve the efficiency of an agent-based model ({ABM}) fitting market-level diffusion data. Using computational experiments, we observe that the {DE} fits {ABM} diffusion processes very well and that the linear correlativity between the {ABM} parameters and their corresponding {DE} estimates is very well in a wide range of settings. However, as significantly systematic biased forecasts of the {DE} for {ABM} diffusion processes exist, the {ABM} cannot be replaced by the {DE} to forecast real-world diffusion. Based on these findings, we design a fast parameter estimation method for the {ABM} by integrating the {DE} into a component to locate an initial point near the optimal solution.The empirical study demonstrates that the proposed procedure can search out the optimal solution by evaluating only a small number of points. Furthermore, the empirical study also demonstrates that certain {ABMs} and the simple averaging method have better explanatory and forecasting performance than the {DE}. This method prepares the {ABM} to forecast innovation diffusion and also makes a contribution to the literature on the validation of {ABM}.},
