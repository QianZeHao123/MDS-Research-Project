	abstract = {Managing non-communicable diseases requires policy makers to adopt a whole systems perspective that adequately represents the complex causal architecture of human behaviour. Agent-based modelling is a computational method to understand the behaviour of complex systems by simulating the actions of entities within the system, including the way these individuals influence and are influenced by their physical and social environment. The potential benefits of this method have led to several calls for greater use in public health research. We discuss three challenges facing potential modellers: model specification, obtaining required data, and developing good practices. We also present steps to assist researchers to meet these challenges and implement their agentbased model.},

However, compared to other approaches, e.g., traditional discrete event simulation, object-oriented simulation and dynamic micro simulation, {MABS} has a number of interesting properties which makes it useful also for other domains. For instance, it supports structure preserving modeling of the simulated reality, simulation of pro-active behavior, parallel computations, and very dynamic simulation scenarios. It is argued that {MABS} is a useful technique for simulating scenarios also in more technical domains. In particular, this hold for the simulation of technical systems that are distributed and involve complex interaction between humans and machines. To illustrate the advantages of {MABS}, an application concerning the monitoring and control of intelligent buildings is described.},

Nonlinear systems are ubiquitous; as mathematician Stanislaw Ulam observed, to speak of “nonlinear science” is like calling zoology the study of “nonelephant animals” (quoted in Campbell et al. 1985, p. 374). The initial phase of research on nonlinear systems focused on deterministic chaos, but more recent studies have investigated the properties of self-organizing systems or anti-chaos. For mathematicians and physicists, the biggest surprise is that complexity lurks within extremely simple systems. For biologists, it is the idea that natural selection is not the sole source of order in the biological world. In the social sciences, it is suggested that emergence—the idea that complex global patterns with new properties can emerge from local interactions—could have a comparable impact.},

	abstract = {Complex Adaptive Systems ({CAS}) is a framework for studying, explaining, and understanding systems of agents that collectively combine to form emergent, global level properties. These agents can be nearly anything, from ants or bees, to brain cells, to water particles in a weather pattern, to groups of cars or people in a city or town. These agents produce emergent patterns via correlated feedbacks throughout the system, feedbacks that create and fortify a basin of attraction: a persistent pattern of behavior that itself is outside of equilibrium. There is also an ever-growing understanding that similar features in complex systems across a diversity of domains may indicate similar fundamental principles at work, and as such there is often utility in using the key features of one system to gain insight into the workings of seemingly distinct fields. Here we also include a brief review of multiple models that attempt to do exactly this, including some of our previous work. Though there is not complete agreement on all aspects and definitions in this field, this introduction also summarizes our understanding of what defines a {CAS}, including the concepts of complexity, agents, adaptation, feedbacks, emergence, and self-organization; and places this definition and its key features in a historical context. Finally we briefly discuss two of the common biases often found that the tools of {CAS} can help counteract: the hierarchical bias, assuming a strong top-down organization; and the complexity bias, the tendency to assign complicated features to agents that turn out to be quite simple.},

In the first category, there are approaches that attempt to represent the cognitive state of rational agents and characterize logically the way such a state leads a rational agent to act. It begins by motivating this approach. It then describes four of the best-known such logical frameworks and discusses the possible roles that such logics can play in helping to engineer artificial agents. In the second category, there are approaches based on representing the strategic structure of a multiagent environment and, in particular, the powers that agents have, either individually or in coalitions.

Each agent decides on a proper action to solve the task using multiple inputs, e.g., history of actions, interactions with its neighboring agents, and its goal. The {MAS} has found multiple applications, including modeling complex systems, smart grids, and computer networks. Despite their wide applicability, there are still a number of challenges faced by {MAS}, including coordination between agents, security, and task allocation. This survey provides a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of {MAS}, starting from definitions, features, applications, challenges, and communications to evaluation.

Marketing phenomena that are too complex for conventional analytical or empirical approaches can often be modeled using this approach. Agent-based modeling investigates aggregate phenomena by simulating the behavior of individual “agents,” such as consumers or organizations. Some useful examples of agent-based modeling have been published in marketing journals, but widespread acceptance of the agent-based modeling method and publication of this method in the highest-level marketing journals have been slowed by the lack of widely accepted standards of how to do agent-based modeling rigorously. We address this need by proposing guidelines for rigorous agent-based modeling. We demonstrate these guidelines, and the value of agent-based modeling for marketing research, through the use of an example. We use an agent-based modeling approach to replicate the Bass model of the diffusion of innovations, illustrating the use of the proposed guidelines to ensure the rigor of the analysis. We also show how extensions of the Bass model that would be difficult to carry out using traditional marketing research techniques are possible to implement using a rigorous agent-based approach.},

	abstract = {A new approach is suggested under the slogan “Keep it Descriptive Stupid” ({KIDS}) that encapsulates a trend in increasingly descriptive agent-based social simulation. The {KIDS} approach entails one starts with the simulation model that relates to the target phenomena in the most straight-forward way possible, taking into account the widest possible range of evidence, including anecdotal accounts and expert opinion. Simplification is only applied if and when the model and evidence justify this. This contrasts sharply with the {KISS} approach where one starts with the simplest possible model and only moves to a more complex one if forced to. An example multi-agent simulation of domestic water demand and social influence is described.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to help and guide the novice or experienced programmer during the development of agent-based models. In particular, a bottom-up approach to building agent- based models is reviewed. The approach leverages current state-of-the-art techniques in software development and demonstrates a design methodology, known as the 'agile' approach. A case study of an agent-based simulation implementing a memetic social network model of water use within an urban environment is discussed, in line with the framework drawing on concrete examples and source code. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of bottom-up approaches, with suggestions and recommendations for how and why frameworks should be used.},

	abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a large share of the energy demand and greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions in Europe and Switzerland. Bottom-up building stock models ({BSMs}) can be used to assess policy measures and strategies based on a quantitative assessment of energy demand and {GHG} emissions in the building stock over time. Recent developments in {BSM}-related research have focused on modeling the status quo of the stock and comparatively little focus has been given to improving the modeling methods in terms of stock dynamics. This paper presents a {BSM} based on an agent-based modeling approach ({ABBSM}) that models stock development in terms of new construction, retrofit and replacement by modeling individual decisions on the building level. The model was implemented for the residential building stock of Switzerland and results show that it can effectively reproduce the past development of the stock from 2000 to 2017 based on the changes in policy, energy prices, and costs. {ABBSM} improves on current modeling practice by accounting for heterogeneity in the building stock and its effect on uptake of retrofit and renewable heating systems and by incorporating both regulatory or financial policy measures as well as other driving and restricting factors (costs, energy prices).},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Opportunistic fungal pathogens can cause bloodstream infection and severe sepsis upon entering the blood stream of the host. The early immune response in human blood comprises the elimination of pathogens by antimicrobial peptides and innate immune cells, such as neutrophils or monocytes. Mathematical modeling is a predictive method to examine these complex processes and to quantify the dynamics of pathogen-host interactions. Since model parameters are often not directly accessible from experiment, their estimation is required by calibrating model predictions with experimental data. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical model, parameter estimation can be associated with excessively high computational costs in terms of run time and memory. We apply a strategy for reliable parameter estimation where different modeling approaches with increasing complexity are used that build on one another. This bottom-up modeling approach is applied to an experimental human whole-blood infection assay for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Candida albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Aiming for the quantification of the relative impact of different routes of the immune response against this human-pathogenic fungus, we start from a non-spatial state-based model ({SBM}), because this level of model complexity allows estimating {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a priori{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} unknown transition rates between various system states by the global optimization method {\textless}italic{\textgreater}simulated annealing{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Building on the non-spatial {SBM}, an agent-based model ({ABM}) is implemented that incorporates the migration of interacting cells in three-dimensional space. The {ABM} takes advantage of estimated parameters from the non-spatial {SBM}, leading to a decreased dimensionality of the parameter space. This space can be scanned using a local optimization approach, i.e., {\textless}italic{\textgreater}least-squares error estimation{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} based on an {\textless}italic{\textgreater}adaptive regular grid search{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, to predict cell migration parameters that are not accessible in experiment. In the future, spatio-temporal simulations of whole-blood samples may enable timely stratification of sepsis patients by distinguishing hyper-inflammatory from paralytic phases in immune dysregulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
