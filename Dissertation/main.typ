=== Definition and Concept of Agent-Based Modelling

Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is an innovative and powerful modeling and simulation
approach used to study and understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems
@macal_tutorial_2005. The core concept of ABM is to evaluate the impact on an
entire system by simulating the behavior and interactions of numerous autonomous
individuals within it, known as agents. The fundamental premise of ABM is that
even complex phenomena can be understood and simulated through a series of
autonomous agents following specific interaction rules @zheng_primer_2013.

Unlike traditional equation-based modeling methods, ABM employs a rule-based
approach to construct models @dorri_multi-agent_2018, making it particularly
suitable for simulating complex dynamic systems. In ABM, each agent is endowed
with the ability to make autonomous decisions @macal_agent-based_2009, acting
based on its own state, surrounding environment, and interactions with other
agents @macal_everything_2016. These agents not only influence their physical
and social environment but are also influenced by it, forming an intricate
network of interactions.

A key feature of ABM is its capacity to capture heterogeneity within a system,
allowing for the simulation of agents with diverse characteristics and
behaviors, thus more accurately reflecting the diversity of the real world.
Through ABM, researchers can observe and analyze how complex behaviors and
patterns at the system level emerge from simple rules at the individual level.
This "bottom-up" modeling approach makes ABM a powerful tool for studying
emergent phenomena, adaptive behaviors, and the evolution of complex systems.

In ABM, agents are core elements with multiple characteristics, including
autonomy, heterogeneity, proactivity, and reactivity. They can make independent
decisions, interact with each other, learn and adapt, perceive their
environment, and act according to specific rules @davidsson_multi_2001. Agents
typically possess bounded rationality, goal-oriented behavior, and variable
internal states. These features enable ABM to effectively simulate individual
behaviors and overall dynamics in complex systems.

=== ABM modeling process and technical implementation

// Agents: Autonomous individuals with specific attributes and behavioral rules
// Environment: The context in which agents operate
// Interaction Rules: Governing agent-to-agent and agent-environment interactions

The ABM models contains three main components: agents, environment, and interaction rules.

Modeling Process Steps, here I refer to Jennifer @badham_developing_2018 and Gilbert's ABM specification sheet @gilbert_abm_nodate:

+ Define model purpose and scope.
+ Identify and characterize agents.
+ Determine agent behavior theories and decision rules.
+ Establish agent relationships and interaction theories.
+ Design the environment.
+ Choose an ABMS platform and development strategy.
+ Implement learning and evolution strategies.
+ Incorporate security mechanisms.
+ Develop interaction protocols.
+ Collect relevant agent data.
+ Validate agent behavior models.
+ Run simulations and analyze output results.
+ Link micro-level agent behaviors to macro-level system behaviors.
