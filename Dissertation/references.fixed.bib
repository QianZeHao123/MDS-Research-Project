  abstract     = {Managing non-communicable diseases requires policy makers to adopt a whole systems perspective that adequately represents the complex causal architecture of human behaviour. Agent-based modelling is a computational method to understand the behaviour of complex systems by simulating the actions of entities within the system, including the way these individuals influence and are influenced by their physical and social environment. The potential benefits of this method have led to several calls for greater use in public health research. We discuss three challenges facing potential modellers: model specification, obtaining required data, and developing good practices. We also present steps to assist researchers to meet these challenges and implement their agentbased model.},

Some have gone so far as to contend that {ABMS} is a third way of doing science besides deductive and inductive reasoning. Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications in a variety of fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of biowarfare, from modeling consumer behavior to understanding the fall of ancient civilizations, to name a few. This tutorial describes the theoretical and practical foundations of {ABMS}, identifies toolkits and methods for developing {ABMS} models, and provides some thoughts on the relationship between {ABMS} and traditional modeling techniques.},

  abstract     = {? Abstract The study of complex adaptive systems, a subset of nonlinear dynamical systems, has recently become a major focus of interdisciplinary research in the social and natural sciences. Nonlinear systems are ubiquitous; as mathematician Stanislaw Ulam observed, to speak of ??nonlinear science?? is like calling zoology the study of ??nonelephant animals?? (quoted in Campbell et al. 1985, p. 374). The initial phase of research on nonlinear systems focused on deterministic chaos, but more recent studies have investigated the properties of self-organizing systems or anti-chaos. For mathematicians and physicists, the biggest surprise is that complexity lurks within extremely simple systems. For biologists, it is the idea that natural selection is not the sole source of order in the biological world. In the social sciences, it is suggested that emergence??the idea that complex global patterns with new properties can emerge from local interactions??could have a comparable impact.},

@incollection{carmichael_fundamentals_2019,
  abstract     = {Complex Adaptive Systems ({CAS}) is a framework for studying, explaining, and understanding systems of agents that collectively combine to form emergent, global level properties. These agents can be nearly anything, from ants or bees, to brain cells, to water particles in a weather pattern, to groups of cars or people in a city or town. These agents produce emergent patterns via correlated feedbacks throughout the system, feedbacks that create and fortify a basin of attraction: a persistent pattern of behavior that itself is outside of equilibrium. There is also an ever-growing understanding that similar features in complex systems across a diversity of domains may indicate similar fundamental principles at work, and as such there is often utility in using the key features of one system to gain insight into the workings of seemingly distinct fields. Here we also include a brief review of multiple models that attempt to do exactly this, including some of our previous work. Though there is not complete agreement on all aspects and definitions in this field, this introduction also summarizes our understanding of what defines a {CAS}, including the concepts of complexity, agents, adaptation, feedbacks, emergence, and self-organization; and places this definition and its key features in a historical context. Finally we briefly discuss two of the common biases often found that the tools of {CAS} can help counteract: the hierarchical bias, assuming a strong top-down organization; and the complexity bias, the tendency to assign complicated features to agents that turn out to be quite simple.},

A more viable model, one much more faithful to the kind of system that society is more and more recognized to be, is in process of developing out of, or is in keeping with, the modern systems perspective (which we use loosely here to refer to general systems research, cybernetics, information and communication theory, and related fields).

This chapter discusses the state of the art in knowledge representation formalisms for multiagent systems. It divides the work in this area into two categories. In the first category, there are approaches that attempt to represent the cognitive state of rational agents and characterize logically the way such a state leads a rational agent to act. It begins by motivating this approach. It then describes four of the best-known such logical frameworks and discusses the possible roles that such logics can play in helping to engineer artificial agents. In the second category, there are approaches based on representing the strategic structure of a multiagent environment and, in particular, the powers that agents have, either individually or in coalitions. The chapter also discusses coalition logic, alternating-time temporal logic ({ATL}), and epistemic extensions.},

After a brief analysis of the major strengths of the field some crucial weaknesses are analyzed. In particular, the generative power of {ABM} is found to have been underexploited, as the pressure for simple recipes has prevailed and shadowed the application of rich cognitive models. In the second part of the paper, the renewal of interest for Computational Social Science ({CSS}) is focused upon, and several of its variants, such as deductive, generative, and complex {CSS}, are identified and described.

  abstract     = {Agent-based modeling can illuminate how complex marketing phenomena emerge from simple decision rules. Marketing phenomena that are too complex for conventional analytical or empirical approaches can often be modeled using this approach. Agent-based modeling investigates aggregate phenomena by simulating the behavior of individual ??agents,?? such as consumers or organizations. Some useful examples of agent-based modeling have been published in marketing journals, but widespread acceptance of the agent-based modeling method and publication of this method in the highest-level marketing journals have been slowed by the lack of widely accepted standards of how to do agent-based modeling rigorously. We address this need by proposing guidelines for rigorous agent-based modeling. We demonstrate these guidelines, and the value of agent-based modeling for marketing research, through the use of an example. We use an agent-based modeling approach to replicate the Bass model of the diffusion of innovations, illustrating the use of the proposed guidelines to ensure the rigor of the analysis. We also show how extensions of the Bass model that would be difficult to carry out using traditional marketing research techniques are possible to implement using a rigorous agent-based approach.},

A case study of an agent-based simulation implementing a memetic social network model of water use within an urban environment is discussed, in line with the framework drawing on concrete examples and source code. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of bottom-up approaches, with suggestions and recommendations for how and why frameworks should be used.},

  abstract     = {Buildings are responsible for a large share of the energy demand and greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions in Europe and Switzerland. Bottom-up building stock models ({BSMs}) can be used to assess policy measures and strategies based on a quantitative assessment of energy demand and {GHG} emissions in the building stock over time. Recent developments in {BSM}-related research have focused on modeling the status quo of the stock and comparatively little focus has been given to improving the modeling methods in terms of stock dynamics. This paper presents a {BSM} based on an agent-based modeling approach ({ABBSM}) that models stock development in terms of new construction, retrofit and replacement by modeling individual decisions on the building level. The model was implemented for the residential building stock of Switzerland and results show that it can effectively reproduce the past development of the stock from 2000 to 2017 based on the changes in policy, energy prices, and costs. {ABBSM} improves on current modeling practice by accounting for heterogeneity in the building stock and its effect on uptake of retrofit and renewable heating systems and by incorporating both regulatory or financial policy measures as well as other driving and restricting factors (costs, energy prices).},

  abstract     = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Opportunistic fungal pathogens can cause bloodstream infection and severe sepsis upon entering the blood stream of the host. The early immune response in human blood comprises the elimination of pathogens by antimicrobial peptides and innate immune cells, such as neutrophils or monocytes. Mathematical modeling is a predictive method to examine these complex processes and to quantify the dynamics of pathogen-host interactions. Since model parameters are often not directly accessible from experiment, their estimation is required by calibrating model predictions with experimental data. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical model, parameter estimation can be associated with excessively high computational costs in terms of run time and memory. We apply a strategy for reliable parameter estimation where different modeling approaches with increasing complexity are used that build on one another. This bottom-up modeling approach is applied to an experimental human whole-blood infection assay for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Candida albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Aiming for the quantification of the relative impact of different routes of the immune response against this human-pathogenic fungus, we start from a non-spatial state-based model ({SBM}), because this level of model complexity allows estimating {\textless}italic{\textgreater}a priori{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} unknown transition rates between various system states by the global optimization method {\textless}italic{\textgreater}simulated annealing{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Building on the non-spatial {SBM}, an agent-based model ({ABM}) is implemented that incorporates the migration of interacting cells in three-dimensional space. The {ABM} takes advantage of estimated parameters from the non-spatial {SBM}, leading to a decreased dimensionality of the parameter space. This space can be scanned using a local optimization approach, i.e., {\textless}italic{\textgreater}least-squares error estimation{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} based on an {\textless}italic{\textgreater}adaptive regular grid search{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, to predict cell migration parameters that are not accessible in experiment. In the future, spatio-temporal simulations of whole-blood samples may enable timely stratification of sepsis patients by distinguishing hyper-inflammatory from paralytic phases in immune dysregulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract     = {The parsimonious Bass diffusion model is frequently used to forecast adoptions of new products and to compare the life cycles of specific products across countries. To meet these goals, reliable parameter estimates are needed. We develop the asymptotic theory for the three key parameters in the Bass model. For this purpose, we need to make assumptions about the stochastic error process. On doing so, we arrive at an alternative version of the Bass model than the one usually considered in practice, because our model includes an additional variable and it incorporates heteroscedastic errors. The asymptotic theory entails that the parameters, on standardization by their standard errors, do not have the conventional asymptotic behavior. For practical purposes, it means that the t-statistics do not have an (approximate) t-distribution. Using simulation experiments, we address the issue of how these findings carry over to practical situations. In a next set of simulation experiments, we compare our representation with that of Bass and Srinivasan and Mason. Among other things, we document that these two approaches seriously overestimate the precision of the parameter estimators, and that some parameters suffer from a substantial bias. An analysis of 12 series concerning compact disc penetration supports these simulation results. We see the same type of bias in parameter estimates, and our model delivers more accurate forecasts.},

@article{massiani_choice_2015,
  abstract     = {Bass diffusion models are one of the competing paradigms to forecast the diffusion of innovative products or technologies. This approach posits that diffusion patterns can be modeled through two mechanisms: Innovators adopt the new product and imitators purchase the new product when getting in contact with existing users. Crucial for the implementation of the method are the values assigned to the two parameters, usually referred to as p and q, which mathematically describe innovation and imitation mechanisms. The present paper is based on the findings of a research project about policy measures to promote the diffusion of Electric Vehicles in Germany. It investigates how practitioners could choose adequate values for the Bass model parameters to forecast new automotive technologies diffusion with a focus on Electric Vehicles. It considers parameters provided by the literature as well as ad hoc parameter estimations based on real market data for Germany. Our investigation suggests that researchers may be in trouble in electing adequate parameter values since the different eligible parameter values exhibit dramatic variations. Literature values appear discussible and widely variable while ad hoc estimates appear poorly conclusive. A serious problem is that ad-hoc estimates of the Bass p value are highly sensitive to the assumed market potential M. So for plausible values of M, p varies on a high scale. Unless more consolidation takes place in this area, or more confidence can be placed on ad hoc estimates, these findings issue a warning for the users of such approaches and on the policy recommendations that would derive from their use.},

Since publication in 1969, it has guided marketing research on diffusion. This paper illustrates the limitations of the {BDM}, using mobile diffusion as a context. We fit the {BDM} to two large developed markets, the {USA} and Germany, and the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China. We show that the parameters of the classical {BDM} may change substantially if the time period considered is changed by a single year. The diffusion of mobile communication does not follow an S-curve in some cases. We do not formulate an empirical alternative, but we suggest the structure of an integrated diffusion mode that treats adoption as one of five phase changes of the diffusion process. We trace the diffusion of mobile communications in India, and show that the integrated diffusion model provides a framework for understanding this case. We show that diffusion is a complex phenomenon, and that simplistic approaches are not equal to the task of explaining it.},

Since the publication of the Bass model in 1969, innovation of new diffusion theory has sparked considerable research among marketing science scholars, operational researchers and mathematicians. This study considers the Bass Model for forecasting the diffusion of new products or an innovation in the Malaysian society. The objective of the proposed model is to represent the level of spread on new products among a given set of society in terms of a simple mathematical function that elapsed since the introduction of new products. With limited amount of data available for new products, a robust Bass model was developed to forecast the sales volume. A procedure of the proposed diffusion model was designed and the parameters were estimated. Results obtained by applying the proposed model and numerical calculation show that the proposed Bass diffusion model is robust and effective for forecasting demand of new products. This study concludes that the newly developed bass diffusion of demand function has significantly contributed for forecasting the diffusion of new products.},

Only directed-advice networks (e.g., Google+) clearly identify influential consumers. In addition, the results challenge conventional wisdom that firms should target advisers assuming that they have the strongest influence on new product adoption. This study contradicts this common assumption and reveals that structural equivalence drives product adoption more than cohesion because advisees' adoption pressures advisers to purchase the product as well.

The present study proposes that the effect of the size of the group of consumers who have already adopted a new product on an individual consumer's decision to adopt this product is contingent upon the consumer's two predispositions: the need for assimilation and the need for distinctiveness. Results of empirical research suggested that differently perceived subgroup sizes fulfill consumers' dual needs for distinctiveness and assimilation differently. The influence of the adopters' group size on a consumer's decision to adopt a new product varied among individuals with different levels of needs for distinctiveness and assimilation: when need for distinctiveness was low, the higher was the need for assimilation and the larger was the perceived group size, the higher was the probability of adopting the product. When the need for distinctiveness was high, the lower was the need for assimilation and the larger was the perceived group size, the lower was the probability of adopting the product. In addition, when the need for both distinctiveness and assimilation were high, the probability of adopting the product rose as the perceived group size increased. Implications for product variation, marketing communication, and target groups are discussed. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@misc{catalini_seeding_2016,
  abstract     = {In October 2014, all 4,494 undergraduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were given access to Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency. As a unique feature of the experiment, students who would generally adopt first were placed in a situation where many of their peers received access to the technology before them, and they then had to decide whether to continue to invest in this digital currency or exit. Our results suggest that when natural early adopters are delayed relative to their peers, they are more likely to reject the technology. We present further evidence that this appears to be driven by identity, in that the effect occurs in situations where natural early adopters' delay relative to others is most visible, and in settings where the natural early adopters would have been somewhat unique in their tech-savvy status. We then show not only that natural early adopters are more likely to reject the technology if they are delayed, but that this rejection generates spillovers on adoption by their peers who are not natural early adopters. This suggests that small changes in the initial availability of a technology have a lasting effect on its potential: Seeding a technology while ignoring early adopters' needs for distinctiveness is counterproductive.},

To advance the research further, this paper presents an extensive literature review of academic publications in the area of buying decision-making process in marketing and its status. Furthermore, the paper presents latest trends and themes that emerge there. Based on 24 journal articles, reports and marketing books, the core models and theories in this area were evaluated and discussed. Moreover, a framework of "moments that matter" in consumer decision-making process and factors that influence them was elaborated for a possibility to influence consumer behaviour in favour of company??s offers. Furthermore, recommendations for marketers were suggested for deeper understanding the consumer behaviour and their buying strategies to empower marketing campaigns and be a success in the market. The paper also suggests several directions for future research related to buying behaviour.},

                  in verbruikersgedragnavorsing gebruik om die navorsing
                  te struktureer en te konseptualiseer. Verskeie
                  van die tradisionele modelle ?C wat in die laat sestiger en sewentigerjare saamgestel is - is in handboeke beskikbaar wat terselfdertyd die teorie ter ondersteuning bied en die stappe van die   verbruikersbesluitnemingsproses definieer en bespreek.
                  Verbruikersbesluitneming word meestal in
                  terme van vyf stadia voorgehou. Die modelle verskil
                  grootliks ten opsigte van die klem en konteks
                  sowel as detail wat ingesluit word. In die tagtigerjare het navorsers begin besef dat die tradisionele modelle van verbruikersbesluitneming nie noodwendig die korrekte beeld van die verbruikersbesluitnemingsproses
                  weergee nie, Verskeie navorsers het resultate van studies gepubliseer om aan te toon dat alternatiewe tot die tradisionele verbruikersbesluitnemingsmodelle
                  gevind moes word. Feitlik sonder uitsondering toon besware ??n oorbeklemtoning van eksterne en omgewingsfaktore op verbruikersbesluitneming sowel as ??n wanvoorstelling dat aktiewe beplanning en rasionele denke komplekse besluitneming rig.  verbruikersbesluitneming het oor jare baie meer kompleks geraak as gevolg van ??n groter verskeidenheid produkte wat beskikbaar is, ontwikkeling op die gebied van tegnologie, w??reldinvloede, groter bedingingsmag van
                  werkende vroue wat ook op besluitnemingstrategie?

                  daarvan om tradisionele besluitnemingsmodelle
                  te gebruik om bepaalde prosesse voor te stel, is nie
                  meer haalbaar nie. Die positivisme wat algemeen as perspektief vir die beskouiing van  verbruikersbesluitneming beskou is (en nog steeds deur sommge beskou word) blyk nie al die moontlikhede te bied om die fenomeen te beskryf nie. Sterk steun vir die implimentering van subjektivistiese benadering en veral kwalitatiewe navorsingstegnieke in navorsing waar die verbruiker toegelaat word om gedagtes en idees spontaan te ontvou, word bepleit. In ooreenstemming met ??n voorstel van Sheth (1981) word navorsers op die
                  gebied van verbruikersgedrag in die  verbruikerswetenskap gemotiveer om kreatief te dink binne minder rigiede teoretiese raamwerke sodat daar deur middel van navorsingsmetodes en tegnieke wat

  abstract     = {Companies have historically invested in large research and development departments to drive innovation and provide sustainable growth. This model, however, is eroding due to a number of factors. What is emerging is a more open model, where companies recognize that not all good ideas will come from inside the organization and not all good ideas created within the organization can be successfully marketed internally. To date, Open Innovation concepts have been regarded as relevant primarily to ??high-technology?? industries, with examples that include Lucent, 3Com, {IBM}, Intel and Millenium Pharmaceuticals. In this article, we identify organizations in industries outside ??high technology' that are early adopters of the concept. Our findings demonstrate that many Open Innovation concepts are already in use in a wide range of industries. We document practices that appear to assist organizations adopting these concepts, and discover that Open Innovation is not ipso facto a recipe for outsourcing R\&D. We conclude that Open Innovation has utility as a paradigm for industrial innovation beyond high tech to more traditional and mature industries.},

This study systematically reviews the application of the {ABM} paradigm in 86 mobility transition studies. The study reveals several research gaps and proposes avenues for future research. Our review highlights that (i) the field has considerably matured in studying the diffusion of electric vehicles, (ii) both price-based and preference-based scenarios for mobility transition should be considered in future research, (iii) most of the empirical model calibrations have been confined to Western countries. Not only will the literature benefit from similar research in other Western regions, but also from non-Western nations with their unique mobility transition pathways, (iv) the conceptual modelling framework of studies can be divided into the two categories of theory-driven and heuristic models. The theory-driven models, which include psychological and non-psychological (e.g., activity-based travel) models, tend to use well-established behavioural rules, (v) most of the models have used the random utility maximization concept, social psychological models, and other simple assumptions/thresholds for the decision-making process of agents, (vi) half of the studies did not validate their models, and (vii) two-thirds of studies omitted to discuss interaction topology among agents. Major remaining challenges and gaps are identified in the review.},

@article{bohlmann_effects_2010,
  abstract     = {Innovations usually have an initial impact on very few people. The period of learning or early evaluation precedes the diffusion of the technology into the wider addressed population. More than a transfer, this is best characterized as communication of benefits, costs, and compatibility with earlier technologies and a relative assessment of the new state of the art. Innovation development by an organization or individual creates not just a device (i.e., process or tacit knowledge) but concomitantly a capacity on the part of other organizations or persons to use, adopt, replicate, enhance, or modify the technology, skills, or knowledge for their own purposes. How innovations actually diffuse is to understand the communication of progress, and this framing helps one to design innovations and also design the marketing and testing programs to ready innovations for market and launch them efficiently. Diffusion theory's main focus is on the flow of information within a social system, such as via mass media and word-of-mouth communications. This theory presents often in the form of mathematical models of innovation and imitation. Distinct from classical diffusion models, however, consumers are not all identical in how they connect to others within a market or how they respond to information. We examine the effects of various network structures and relational heterogeneity on innovation diffusion within market networks. Specifically, network topology (the structure of how individuals in the market are connected) and the strength of communication links between innovator and follower market segments (a form of relational heterogeneity) are studied. Several research questions concerning network heterogeneity are addressed with an agent-based modeling approach. The present study's findings are based on simulation results that show important effects of network structure on the diffusion process. The ability to speed diffusion varies significantly according to within- and cross-segment communications within a heterogeneous network structure. The implications of the present approach for new product diffusion are discussed, and future research directions are suggested that may add useful insights into the complex social networks inherent to diffusion. A simple summary is that discovery of significant prime communicator nodes in a network allows innovation development practices to be better calibrated to realistically multiple market segments.},

  abstract     = {Agent-based model ({ABM}) has been widely used to explore the influence of complex interactions and individual heterogeneity on the diffusion of innovation, while it is seldom used as a forecasting tool in the innovation diffusion literature. This paper introduces a novel approach of forecasting new product diffusion with {ABMs}. The {ABM} is built on the hidden influence network ({HIN}) over which the innovation diffuses. An efficient method is presented to estimate non-structural parameters (i.e., p, q and m) and a multinomial logistic model is formulated to identify the type of the {HIN} for diffusion data. The simulation study shows that the trained logistic model performs well in inferring the {HINs} for most simulated diffusion data sets but poorly for those generated by {ABMs} with similar {HINs}. Therefore, to reduce the possible prediction loss arising from the misspecification of the {HIN}, three methods, namely, the predicted {HIN}, the weighted averaging and simple averaging, are developed to forecast new products diffusion. Their performances are evaluated by using a data set composed of 317 time series on consumer durables penetration. The results show that most identified {HINs} have moderate topology, and that our methods outperform four classical differential equation based diffusion models in both short-term and long-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {This chapter uses an Agent-Based Model ({ABM}) to perform simulated experiments on adoption of a reverse innovation under the influence of paid advertising messages and word of mouth. The main objective is analyze the adoption and diffusion of a reverse innovation across a developing country??the country in which a reverse innovation is first launched??to then analyze its further diffusion in a developed country. While most of literature on diffusion and adoption of innovation is focused on aggregated transversal studies, this chapter utilizes an {ABM} to analyze the phenomenon at the micro market level, that is, observable consumer decisions. As secondary data on sales of reverse innovations is almost unavailable, this study relies on an experimental design with different levels of paid advertising messages and word of mouth, network densities, and market sizes. Results show that a reverse innovation diffuses faster in a developing country and reaches a larger market segment than the diffusion in a developed country. Managers are called to enact an ambidextrous marketing strategy across countries and to expect differentiated diffusion patterns.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides theoretical arguments and simulation evidence regarding how a differential equation-based diffusion model ({DE}) can be used to improve the efficiency of an agent-based model ({ABM}) fitting market-level diffusion data. Using computational experiments, we observe that the {DE} fits {ABM} diffusion processes very well and that the linear correlativity between the {ABM} parameters and their corresponding {DE} estimates is very well in a wide range of settings. However, as significantly systematic biased forecasts of the {DE} for {ABM} diffusion processes exist, the {ABM} cannot be replaced by the {DE} to forecast real-world diffusion. Based on these findings, we design a fast parameter estimation method for the {ABM} by integrating the {DE} into a component to locate an initial point near the optimal solution.The empirical study demonstrates that the proposed procedure can search out the optimal solution by evaluating only a small number of points. Furthermore, the empirical study also demonstrates that certain {ABMs} and the simple averaging method have better explanatory and forecasting performance than the {DE}. This method prepares the {ABM} to forecast innovation diffusion and also makes a contribution to the literature on the validation of {ABM}.},

@article{helfmann_modelling_2023,
  abstract     = {Digital communication has made the public discourse considerably more complex, and new actors and strategies have emerged as a result of this seismic shift. Aside from the often-studied interactions among individuals during opinion formation, which have been facilitated on a large scale by social media platforms, the changing role of traditional media and the emerging role of ??influencers?? are not well understood, and the implications of their engagement strategies arising from the incentive structure of the attention economy even less so. Here we propose a novel framework for opinion dynamics that can accommodate various versions of opinion dynamics as well as account for different roles, namely that of individuals, media and influencers, who change their own opinion positions on different time scales. Numerical simulations of instances of this framework show the importance of their relative influence in creating qualitatively different opinion formation dynamics: with influencers, fragmented but short-lived clusters emerge, which are then counteracted by more stable media positions. The framework allows for mean-field approximations by partial differential equations, which reproduce those dynamics and allow for efficient large-scale simulations when the number of individuals is large. Based on the mean-field approximations, we can study how strategies of influencers to gain more followers can influence the overall opinion distribution. We show that moving towards extreme positions can be a beneficial strategy for influencers to gain followers. Finally, our framework allows us to demonstrate that optimal control strategies allow other influencers or media to counteract such attempts and prevent further fragmentation of the opinion landscape. Our modelling framework contributes to a more flexible modelling approach in opinion dynamics and a better understanding of the different roles and strategies in the increasingly complex information ecosystem.},

Recent existing reseach evidence indicates a limited effect of opinion leaders on diffusion processes, yet these studies take into account merely the network position of opinion leaders without addressing their influential power. Empirical findings of our study show that opinion leaders, in addition to having a more central network position, possess more accurate knowledge about a product and tend to be less susceptible to norms and more innovative. Experiments that address these attributes, using an agent-based model, demonstrate that opinion leaders increase the speed of the information stream and the adoption process itself. Furthermore, they increase the maximum adoption percentage. These results indicate that targeting opinion leaders remains a valuable marketing strategy.},

In this research, we investigate which opinion leader is the best marketing choice in terms of diffusion speed and maximum cumulative number of adopters, using a social network approach and threshold model. On the basis of the simulation result, we find that opinion leaders with high sociality are the best ones for fast diffusion, whereas those with high distance centrality are the best ones for the maximum cumulative number of adopters. Moreover, we conclude that the characteristics of effective opinion leaders selected as initial adopters could vary depending on the characteristics of the social network and type of innovation. Finally, we find that opinion leaders affect the diffusion process only when the percentage of initial adopters reaches a critical mass.},

  abstract     = {Social media influencers have replaced the phenomenon of traditional influencers playing a role in digital marketing in recent years. On the other hand, academic literature needs to explain this phenomenon fully. The purpose of this study is to understand the role of social media influencers in social interaction and their implications for purchasing decisions for cosmetic products to provide an overview of companies in making business decisions using Instagram. The research employs agent-based modeling simulation ({ABM}), a combination of a deductive approach using the theory of planned behavior ({TPB}) and an inductive practice through observation. The number of posts, the number of likes and comments, the number of followers, attractiveness of influencers utilize. These parameters lead to purchasing decisions, which subsequently identify with sales figures. This study categorizes three influencers with different characteristics. The simulation results show that influencer [B] sales are the highest with repeated iterations, then influencer [A] and influencer [C] with several parameters that explain the phenomenon of social media influencers in purchasing decisions. Another discovery was that the parameter quantity of content has the most significant influence on buying decisions, followed by other parameters that also contribute significantly. To provide businesses the chance to consider these factors when selecting the right blend of social media influencers to aid product sales.},

As an extension of the existing agent-based model, it takes into account some important factors such as influencer avoidance and product competition and modifies some existing parameters to provide a more realistic approach for simulating marketing campaigns. Based on it, we define a novel set function named as dual-profit function. It is proven to be nonsubmodular and nonsupermodular. The dual-profit maximization ({DPM}) problem which regards dual-profit function as its objective function and the {DPM} algorithm used to address {DPM} problem is proposed.

@article{bertotti_bass_2016,
  abstract     = {The Bass model, which is an effective forecasting tool for innovation diffusion based on large collections of empirical data, assumes an homogeneous diffusion process. We introduce a network structure into this model and we investigate numerically the dynamics in the case of networks with link density P(k)=c/k??, where k=1,??,N. The resulting curve of the total adoptions in time is qualitatively similar to the homogeneous Bass curve corresponding to a case with the same average number of connections. The peak of the adoptions, however, tends to occur earlier, particularly when ?? and N are large (i.e., when there are few hubs with a large maximum number of connections). Most interestingly, the adoption curve of the hubs anticipates the total adoption curve in a predictable way, with peak times which can be, for instance when N=100, between 10\% and 60\% of the total adoptions peak. This may allow to monitor the hubs for forecasting purposes. We also consider the case of networks with assortative and disassortative correlations and a case of inhomogeneous advertising where the publicity terms are ??targeted?? on the hubs while maintaining their total cost constant.},

  abstract     = {Using a heterogeneous mean-field network formulation of the Bass innovation diffusion model and recent exact results on the degree correlations of Barabasi-Albert networks, we compute the times of the diffusion peak and compare them with those on scale-free networks which have the same scale-free exponent but different assortativity properties. We compare our results with those obtained for the {SIS} epidemic model with the spectral method applied to adjacency matrices. It turns out that diffusion times on finite Barabasi-Albert networks are at a minimum. This may be due to a little-known property of these networks: whereas the value of the assortativity coefficient is close to zero, they look disassortative if one considers only a bounded range of degrees, including the smallest ones, and slightly assortative on the range of the higher degrees. We also find that if the trickle-down character of the diffusion process is enhanced by a larger initial stimulus on the hubs (via a inhomogeneous linear term in the Bass model), the relative difference between the diffusion times for {BA} networks and uncorrelated networks is even larger, reaching, for instance, the 34\% in a typical case on a network with 104 nodes.},

  abstract     = {Non-spatial ecological networks provide insight into the organization and interaction between biological entities. More recently, biological dispersal is modelled using spatial networks, static sets of georeferenced habitat patches that connect based on a species?? maximum dispersal distance. However, dispersal is complex, where spatial patterns at the landscape scale emerge from interactions between ecological entities and landscape features at much finer individual scales. Agent-based modelling ({ABM}) is a computational representation of complex systems capable of capturing this complexity. Therefore, this study develops a network-{ABM} (N-{ABM}) that combines network and complex systems theory to simulate complex evolving spatial networks. The developed N-{ABM} approach is implemented on the case study of the emerald ash borer ({EAB}) bark beetle using geospatial datasets in Ontario, Canada. The N-{ABM} generates dynamic spatial network structures that emerge from interactions between the {EAB} and tree agents at the individual scale. The resulting networks are analyzed using graph theory measures. Analysis of the results indicates a relationship between preferential attachment in insect host selection and the emergent scale-free network structure. The N-{ABM} approach can be used to represent dynamic ecological networks and provides insight into how network structure emerges from {EAB} dispersal dynamics, useful for forest management.},

@article{smith_using_2020,
  abstract     = {Agent-based modeling holds great potential as an analytical tool. Agent-based models ({ABMs}) are, however, also vulnerable to critique, as they often employ stylized social worlds, with little connection to the actual environment in question. Given these concerns, there has been a recent call to more fully incorporate empirical data into {ABMs}. This article falls in this tradition, exploring the benefits of using sampled ego network data in {ABMs} of cultural diffusion. Thus, instead of relying on full network data, which can be difficult and costly to collect, or no empirical network data, which is convenient but not empirically grounded, we offer a middle-ground, one combining {ABMs} with recent work on network sampling. The main question is whether this approach is effective. We provide a test of the approach using six complete networks; the test also includes a range of diffusion models (where actors follow different rules of adoption). For each network, we take a random ego network sample and use that sample to infer the full network structure. We then run a diffusion model through the known, complete networks, as well as the inferred networks, and compare the results. The results, on the whole, are quite strong: Across all analyses, the diffusion curves based on the sampled data are very similar to the curves based on the true, complete network. This suggests that ego network sampling can, in fact, offer a practical means of incorporating empirical data into an agent-based model.},

  abstract     = {An agent-based model is developed for investigating the role of individual behaviour and network influence on energy innovation diffusion. Behaviour is based on how agents value specific attributes of a technology, and network effects are disaggregated into indirect influence through exposure to a larger population, and direct influence through personal contacts. We find that network influence can have a positive effect on accelerating the diffusion of new energy innovations, but can be counteracted by risk adverse behaviour. Combined direct and indirect network effects can have as strong an influence on adoption behaviour as personal preferences. Interestingly, we find that indirect influence from the larger population can have a greater effect than direct personal contacts on an individual. This implies a feedback between population and sub-population level signals on adoption behaviour which warrants further exploration as a mechanism to induce individual level change.},

	abstract = {A new approach is suggested under the slogan “Keep it Descriptive Stupid” ({KIDS}) that encapsulates a trend in increasingly descriptive agent-based social simulation. The {KIDS} approach entails one starts with the simulation model that relates to the target phenomena in the most straight-forward way possible, taking into account the widest possible range of evidence, including anecdotal accounts and expert opinion. Simplification is only applied if and when the model and evidence justify this. This contrasts sharply with the {KISS} approach where one starts with the simplest possible model and only moves to a more complex one if forced to. An example multi-agent simulation of domestic water demand and social influence is described.},

  abstract    = {Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) methods have been applied in a spectrum of research domains. This primer focuses on ABMS in the transportation interdisciplinary domain, describes the basic concepts of ABMS and the recent progress of ABMS in transportation areas, and elaborates on the scope and key characteristics of past agent-based transportation models, based on research results that have been reported in the literature. Specifically, the objectives of this primer are to explain the basic concept of ABMS and various ABMS methodologies scoped in the literature, review ABMS applications emerging in transportation studies in the last few decades, describe the general ABMS modeling frameworks and commonly shared procedures exhibited in a variety of transportation applications, outline the strength and limitation of ABMS in various transportation applications, and demonstrate that ABMS exhibits certain comparable modeling outcomes compared to classical approaches through a traveler��s route choice decision-making process example. The target audiences of this primer are researchers and practitioners in the interdisciplinary fields of transportation, who are specialized or interested in social science models, behavioral models, activity-based travel demand models, lane use models, route choice models, human factors, and artificial intelligence with applications in transportation.},
